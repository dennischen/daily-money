<h2>Concept</h2>
<blockquote>
    <img src="how2use1.png"  style="float: right; margin: 10px;margin-right:20px" />
    The concept of daily money is very simple
    <ol>
    <li>Different accounts (you create accounts depends on your case)</li>
    <li>Money transaction between accounts. (you record detail for each transaction)</li>
    </ol> 
</blockquote>
<h2>Accounts</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p style="min-height: 82px"> 
    <img src="how2use2.png"  style="float: left; margin: 10px;margin-right:20px" />    
    There are 5 types account, you can create/edit/delete it in Account Manager page.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li class="income"><i>Income</i> : salary etc..</li>
    <li class="expense"><i>Expense</i> : food, entertainment etc.</li>
    <li class="asset"><i>Asset</i> : cash, bank</li>
    <li class="liability"><i>Liability</i> : credit card, loan.</li>
    <li class="other"><i>Other</i> : ...like a asset but is not asset.</li>
    </ol>  
    * To sort your account, you just add 1,2,.. or A.B,.. as the prefix of name of account.<br/>
    * Account name could have a hierarchical by naming with .(dot), Ex: Food.lunch, Food.dinner . When editing transaction detail, it provides better selecting of account.<br/>

<h2>The transaction detail</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p style="min-height: 82px"> 
    <img src="how2use3.png"  style="float: left; margin: 10px" />
    When you spent money then you can click the Add Detail on the Main page to create a new record. for example you spent $10 bought a meal, in Detail Editor page, you
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li class="asset">Select from account : Cash</li>
    <li class="expense">Select to account : Food</li>
    <li>Select date : today</li>
    <li>Input money by calculator : 10</li>
    <li>Input description : hot dog, coke.</li>
    <li>click <i>Create</i> then click <i>Close</i> if no more transaction needs to be created.</li>
    </ol> 

    this is a just very common use case of daily-money, but, what if your salary is deposit to bank directly, you use credit card buy books on internet? 
    daily-money provide different type of account s, and you could create various accounts against 5 account type.

<h2>Use cases</h2>
<blockquote>
<h3>Salary to Bank</h3>
<blockquote>
    <span class="income"><b>From</b> : Salary</span><br/>
    <span class="asset"><b>To</b> : Bank</span><br/>
</blockquote>
<h3>Bank to Cash</h3>
<blockquote>
    <span class="asset"><b>From</b> : Bank</span><br/>
    <span class="asset"><b>To</b> : Cash</span><br/>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2>Balance Reports</h2>
<img src="how2use4.png"  style="float: right; margin: 10px" />
<blockquote>
<h3>Ranged Balance</h3>
<blockquote>
    In ranged balance reports, I count balance of all the details that you created. The balance is calculated in a time range (current week, current month, current year, or you can change to other range by click the arrow button)
</blockquote>
<h3>Cumulated Balance</h3>
<blockquote>
    To calculate cumulated balance (ex, how much cash I have now, how much liability I have now. not how much I spent this week), 
    you have to set a initial value to a account(generally <i class="asset">Asset</i> or <i  class="liability">Liability</i> type accounts have non-zero initial value. 
    <i  class="income">Income</i> and <i  class="expense">Expense</i> type account should have no initial value).<br/>
    If you forgot to set initial value of an account, there is a simple way to adjust it. for example ,
    "I have cash 333, but cumulated balance reports shows I have cash -100)
    <ol>
    <li>Edit cash account</li>
    <li>Set initial value of cash to 433, result of (333 - (-100))</li>
    </ol>  
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h2>Multiple Books</h2>

<blockquote>
<p > 
    You can create multiple-books and active one book as the 'Working-Book'.
    You can define a currency symbol (ex, '$','¥'..etc) and the position of the symbol of a book.
    After you created a book, application will allocate another database to store accounts and details,
    data between books are not able to be transfer since they are isolated.
</p>
<p>    
    When exporting current data to CSV, it will export two files, details.csv and accounts.csv, which are sharing 
    between all books, and another two files,details-'id'.cvs and accounts-'id'.csv, 'id' is the book id),for
    working book only, 
    When importing data from CSV, you can choose to import from shared or non-shared file.
</p>
<p>     
    If you delete a book, the database of that book will also be delete (included accounts and details), 
    the default book(id = 0) and current working book are not delete-able, 
</p>
